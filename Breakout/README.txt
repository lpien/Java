This is a version of the game Breakout that I did for my Intro to Programming class.  The Break.java file contains all the code that involves moving the ball and paddle around the screen and creating the bricks.  The BreakoutTest.java file initializes the JFrame.

To play, the user must use the arrow keys to move the paddle around the board.  The user has three lives and the game is over once all three lives are lost.  The user also may pause and start the game using the keys 's' for stop and 'g' for go.
