My assignment contains four different classes.  
MyNode.java contains the constructor for the node.  It implements a data object for the node and a next node that represents the path from one node to the next.  
MyLinkedList.java is an interface containing all of the methods that will be written in the class
LinkedList.java.  In this class, there is a constructor for LinkedList() which initializes a beginning node.
The insert method takes in data and creates a new node if it does not already exist.  The delete method 
deletes a node from the list and connects the previous node to the proceeding node.  The lookup method
returns true if the data in the list exists, and false if the data does not exist.  isEmpty returns true
if the node does not contain data, and method printList prints out the data in all the nodes in the list.
